# Artificial Neural Network using the Iris Dataset

This project is a C# implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained on the famous Iris dataset using gradient descent. The project was originally created as a part of a class assignment and showcases the core concepts of neural network training.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following C# files:

1. **Iris.cs**: This file defines the data structure for the Iris dataset, including the attributes for each iris instance.

2. **Layer.cs**: This file contains the data structures and methods related to the individual layers of the ANN. This includes the layer's neurons, weights, biases, and the methods used for training and updating these parameters.

3. **NeuralNetwork.cs**: This file holds the main data structure and training methods for the ANN. It combines the layers to form the complete network and manages the forward and backward propagation processes.

4. **Program.cs**: This file is where the model is created and tested and the best runs are outputed to the console.

## How It Works

- The neural network is trained using gradient descent to minimize the error in predictions. The network architecture and parameters can be adjusted in the code to explore different configurations.
  
- The training process was run multiple times, and the best-performing model was saved. These values were later used in a separate GUI application (not included in this repository) to display the networkâ€™s performance.
